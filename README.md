Papers written about created Deep Learning Projects


# ClearSky

ClearSky paper is my first Machine Learning Project. It uses Satellite based data to track fires, and create a prediction about how the fire will spread for the next day.

#Text Style Transfer

This project uses transformer based networks combined with Reinforcement Learning to analyze a comment and then create a sentence which shares the content of the first while having the opposite sentiment.

#Upscaled Resolution on Multi Frame Remote Sensed Images

This project uses multiple satellite views of an area to build a higher resolution image of the area through Super Resolution Networks. Public Satellite Datasets commonly come in mid to coarse levels of resolution based on the satellite however with wide archives available, this project exploits that to have a finer resolution dataset for projects such as ClearSky
